I am a programmer focusing on back-end development. I write code in Java, Kotlin, and Haskell.
My main interests are object-oriented and functional programming, test-driven development, data structures and algorithms,
concurrency, design patterns, software architecture, DevOps, software engineering principles,
and computational linguistics.

I maintain also these websites:
